#	Hibernate Merging and Refreshing Entities

-	merge and refresh are completely opposite of each other
-	refresh(Object object) is used to sync the persistent object with data present in the db
-	merge(Object object) method is used to update the changes present in the persistent object to db


##	Refreshing Hibernate Entities Using refresh() Method

-	Sometimes we face situation where we application database is modified with some external application/agent and thus corresponding hibernate entity in your application actually becomes out of sync with it’s database representation i.e. having old data
- 	In this case, you can use session.refresh() method to re-populate the entity with latest data available in database


			public void refresh(Object object) throws HibernateException
			public void refresh(Object object, LockMode lockMode) throws HibernateException

-	Example of refresh method:

			public class RefreshEntityExample
			{
			   public static void main(String[] args)
			   {
				  Session sessionOne = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				  sessionOne.beginTransaction();
				   
				  //Create new Employee object
				  EmployeeEntity emp = new EmployeeEntity();
				  emp.setEmployeeId(1);
				  emp.setFirstName("Lokesh");
				  emp.setLastName("Gupta");
				   
				  //Save employee
				  sessionOne.save(emp);
				  sessionOne.getTransaction().commit();
				  sessionOne.close();
				   
				  //Verify employee's firstname
				  System.out.println(verifyEmployeeFirstName(1, "Lokesh"));
				   
				  Session sessionTwo = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				  sessionTwo.beginTransaction();
				   
				  //This
				  emp.setFirstName("Vikas");
				  sessionTwo.refresh(emp);
				   
				  sessionTwo.getTransaction().commit();
				  sessionTwo.close();
				   
				  System.out.println(emp.getFirstName().equals("Lokesh"));
				   
				  HibernateUtil.shutdown();
			   } 
				
			   private static boolean verifyEmployeeFirstName(Integer employeeId, String firstName){
				  Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				  EmployeeEntity employee = (EmployeeEntity) session.load(EmployeeEntity.class, employeeId);
				  //Verify first name
				  boolean result = firstName.equals(employee.getFirstName());
				  session.close();
				  //Return verification result
				  return result;
			   }
			}
			

##	Merging Hibernate Entities Using merge() Method


-	Method merge() does exactly opposite to what refresh() does i.e. 
-	It updates the database with values from a detached entity
-	Refresh method was updating the entity with latest database information. So basically, both are exactly opposite.

-	Merging is performed when we want to bring detached entity to persistent state again and push detached entity’s changes to (or overriding) the database. 
-	The method signatures for the merge operations are:
	
			Object merge(Object object)
			Object merge(String entityName, Object object)

- 	In below code we sending detached empEntity to merge method.

			EmployeeEntity mergedEmpEntity = session.merge(empEntity);
			
			
	-	’empEntity’ is detached entity when it is passed to merge() method.
	-	merge() method will search for an already loaded EmployeeEntity instance with identifier information taken from empEntity
	-	If such persistent entity is found then it will be used for updates
	-	Other wise a new EmployeeEntity is loaded into session using same identifier information as present in ’empEntity’
	-	Data is copied from ’empEntity’ to new found/loaded entity
	-	Because new/found entity is persistent, all data copied to it from ’empEntity’ is automatically saved into database.
	-	Reference of that new entity is returned from merge() method and is assigned to ‘mergedEmpEntity’ variable.
	-	’empEntity’ is still detached entity.
