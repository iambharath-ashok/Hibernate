# Hibernate

-	Hibernate is an open source Java persistence framework project
-	It performs powerful object-relational mapping and query databases using HQL and SQL
-	Hibernate is a great tool for ORM mappings in Java


## Hibernate Architecture
![Hibernate-Architecture](https://cdn1.howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Hibernate-Architecture.png)

-	Configuration:
	-	Generally written in hibernate.properties or hibernate.cfg.xml files
	-	For Java configuration, you may find class annotated with @Configuration
	-	hibernate configuration files contains hibernate properties like:
	
		-	hibernate.dialect
		-	hibernate.connection.url
		-	hibernate.connection.user
		-	hibernate.connection.password
		
	-	Configuration is used by Session Factory to communicate with Java Application and the Database	

-	Session Factory:

	-	Session Factory is used to get a new session
	-	Application obtains the session from Session Factory instance
	-	Session Factory manages all the sessions in application
	-	Session Factory is used to manage the Second level Cache is the application
	-	Session Factory uses the configuration from hibernate.cfg.xml file
	
-	Session:

	-	Session represents the interaction between the application and the database at any point of time
	-	The instance of a session can be retrieved from the SessionFactory bean
	-	Session manages the life-cycle of entities 
	-	Session instance be used to obtain the transaction instance
	
-	Transaction:

	-	Transaction is a set of tasks 
	-	Transaction enables you to achieve data consistency, and rollback incase something goes unexpected
	-	If one of the tasks in transaction got failed due to some reason, whole transaction will be rolled back
	-	Transaction ensures ACID properties of Database
	
	
-	Query:

	-	Query is an interface from javax.persistence JPA
	-	Query implementation will be provided by JPA implementation like Hibernate
	-	Query instance will be used to send query requests against the database
	-	Query allows applications to query the database for one or more stored objects
	-	Hibernate provides different techniques to query database, including NamedQuery and Criteria API, Native Query

-	Persistent objects:

	-	These are plain old Java objects (POJOs), which get persisted as one of the rows in the related table in the database by hibernate
	-	Persistent Objects are annotated with @Entity annotation
	-	They can be eveb configured in configurations files (hibernate.cfg.xml or hibernate.properties)
	-	Life Cycle of persistent objects are managed by session object-relational
	
	
-	First-level cache:

	-	This is default cache used by Hibernate Session object while interacting with the database
	-	First level cache will be enabled by default
	-	It is also called as session cache and caches objects within the current session
	-	All requests from the Session object to the database must pass through the first-level cache or session cache
	-	First-level cache is available with the session object until the Session object is live
	
	
-	Second-level cache	

	-	Second-level Cache is enable or available by default
	-	We need to use the third party cache provides like EHCache or OS Cache to enable the second level cache 
	-	Second level cache will managed by Session-Factory instance
	-	Second-level cache is used to store objects across sessions
	-	This needs to be explicitly enabled and one would be required to provide the cache provider for a second-level cache.
	-	One of the common second-level cache providers is EhCache
