#	Hibernate Entity / Persistence LifeCycle States

![Hibernate-Architecture](https://thoughts-on-java.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Entity-LifeCycle-State-tiny.png)


-	Hibernate works with normal Java objects that your application creates with the new operator
-	Given an instance that is mapped to Hibernate can be in any one of four different states: transient, persistent, detached, or removed


## Transient State

-	Transient objects exist in heap memory
- 	Hibernate does not manage transient objects or persist changes to transient objects
-	To persist the changes to a transient object, we need to attach transient object to any session
-	Hibernate assigns the object an identifier and marks the object as being in persistent state



##	Persistent Object

-	This state is also called as managed state, hibernate manages the persistence for persistent object
-	Hibernate session keeps track of changes made to persistent object


## Detached Object

-	Detached Object represent the previously worked object
-	Changed made to detached object will not be reflected in the database
-	There will be temporary separation b/w db and object
-	A detached object can be created by closing the session that it was associated with, or by evicting it from the session with a call to the session’s evict() method
-	In order to persist changes made to a detached object, the application must reattach it to a valid Hibernate session
-	A detached instance can be associated with a new Hibernate session when application calls one of the load(), refresh(), merge(), update(), or save() methods on the new session with a reference to the detached object
-	 After the call, the detached object would be a persistent object managed by the new Hibernate session



##	Removed Object

-	Removed Object that are worked on previously or being managed by Hibernate
-	Removed Object have been passed to the session’s remove() method
-	Removed Object soon will be deleted as soon as changes held in the session will be committed to database
