#	Hibernate First Level Cache 

-	Caching is a facility provided by ORM frameworks to reduce number calls made to DB in a single transaction
-	Caching is used to provide a fast browsing feel
-	Hibernate achieves the second goal by implementing first level cache
-	Fist level cache in hibernate is enabled by default
-	Session Object manages the First Level Cache
-	First Level cache is also called as Session Cache
-	First level cache associated with session object and will be available only till session object is live
-	It is available to only that particular session object and is not accessible to any other session object in any other part of application

##	Important facts about First Level Cache


-	1.	First level cache is associated with “session” object and other session objects in application can not see it.
-	2.	The scope of cache objects is of session. Once session is closed, cached objects are gone forever.
-	3.	First level cache is enabled by default and you can not disable it.
-	4.	When we query an entity first time, it is retrieved from database and stored in first level cache associated with hibernate session.
-	5.	If we query same object again with same session object, it will be loaded from cache and no sql query will be executed.
-	6.	The loaded entity can be removed from session using evict() method. The next loading of this entity will again make a database call if it has been removed using evict() method.
-	7.	The whole session cache can be removed using clear() method. It will remove all the entities stored in cache.


##	First level cache retrieval example


-	We are trying to retrieve multiple times, but hibernate making DB call only one at first time
-	All Subsequent calls will be retrieved from Hibernate First Level cache or session
-	 second “session.load()” statement does not execute select query again and load the department entity directly

			//Open the hibernate session
			Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
			session.beginTransaction();
			 
			//fetch the department entity from database first time
			DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//fetch the department entity again
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			session.getTransaction().commit();
			HibernateUtil.shutdown();
 
-	Output:
			 
			Hibernate: select department0_.ID as ID0_0_, department0_.NAME as NAME0_0_ from DEPARTMENT department0_ where department0_.ID=?

##	First level cache retrieval example with new session

-	With new session, entity is fetched from database again irrespective of it is already present in any other session in application.
-	We can see that even if the department entity was stored in “session” object, still another database query was executed when we use another session object “sessionTemp”
	
			//Open the hibernate session
			Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
			session.beginTransaction();
			 
			Session sessionTemp = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
			sessionTemp.beginTransaction();
			try
			{
				//fetch the department entity from database first time
				DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
				System.out.println(department.getName());
				 
				//fetch the department entity again
				department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
				System.out.println(department.getName());
				 
				department = (DepartmentEntity) sessionTemp.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
				System.out.println(department.getName());
			}
			finally
			{
				session.getTransaction().commit();
				HibernateUtil.shutdown();
				 
				sessionTemp.getTransaction().commit();
				HibernateUtil.shutdown();
			}
 
Output:
 
			Hibernate: select department0_.ID as ID0_0_, department0_.NAME as NAME0_0_ from DEPARTMENT department0_ where department0_.ID=?

			Hibernate: select department0_.ID as ID0_0_, department0_.NAME as NAME0_0_ from DEPARTMENT department0_ where department0_.ID=?

##	Removing cache objects from first level cache example

-	We can remove some of objects from Session when needed by using evict() method
-	We need to pass the persistent entity that we want to remove from the session
-	clear() method on session will remove all the persistent objects from session
	-	Will clear the whole session by removing all the persistent entities
	
-	evict():
	
	-	evict() is used to remove a particular object from cache associated with session,

-	clear()

	-	clear() method is used to remove all cached objects associated with session
	
-	In the below code evict() method removed the department object from cache so that it was fetched again from database.


	
				//Open the hibernate session
				Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				session.beginTransaction();
				try
				{
					//fetch the department entity from database first time
					DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
					System.out.println(department.getName());
					 
					//fetch the department entity again
					department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
					System.out.println(department.getName());
					 
					session.evict(department);
					//session.clear();
					 
					department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
					System.out.println(department.getName());
				}
				finally
				{
					session.getTransaction().commit();
					HibernateUtil.shutdown();
				}
         
-	Console Output:
         
				Hibernate: select department0_.ID as ID0_0_, department0_.NAME as NAME0_0_ from DEPARTMENT department0_ where department0_.ID=?
