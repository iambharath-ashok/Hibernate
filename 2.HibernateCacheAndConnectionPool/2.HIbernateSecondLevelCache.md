#	Hibernate Second Level Cache


-	Hibernate second level cache is not enabled by default
-	In order to use or enable the second level cache, we need to add the cache provider
-	Hibernate Second level cache is managed by Session Factory and will be accessible from different sessions

## Hibernate Second Level Cache Providers

-	
-	EhCache 
	-	Hibernate will by default shipped with EHCache and it will used as default Second Level Cache
-	OS Cache


##	How second level cache works in Hibernate

-	Whenever hibernate session try to load an entity, the very first place it look for cached copy of entity in first level cache (associated with particular hibernate session).
-	If cached copy of entity is present in first level cache, it is returned as result of load method.
-	If there is no cached entity in first level cache, then second level cache is looked up for cached entity.
-	If second level cache has cached entity, it is returned as result of load method. But, before returning the entity, it is stored in first level cache also so that next invocation to load method for entity will return the entity from first level cache itself, and there will not be need to go to second level cache again.
-	If entity is not found in first level cache and second level cache also, then database query is executed and entity is stored in both cache levels, before returning as response of load() method.
-	Second level cache validate itself for modified entities, if modification has been done through hibernate session APIs.
-	If some user or process make changes directly in database, the there is no way that second level cache update itself until “timeToLiveSeconds” duration has passed for that cache region. In this case, it is good idea to invalidate whole cache and let hibernate build its cache once again. You can use below code snippet to invalidate whole hibernate second level cache.



## Sample code to evict all the entities from second level cache


		/**
		 * Evicts all second level cache hibernate entites. This is generally only
		 * needed when an external application modifies the databaase.
		 */
		public void evict2ndLevelCache() {
			try {
				Map<String, ClassMetadata> classesMetadata = sessionFactory.getAllClassMetadata();
				for (String entityName : classesMetadata.keySet()) {
					logger.info("Evicting Entity from 2nd level cache: " + entityName);
					sessionFactory.evictEntity(entityName);
				}
			} catch (Exception e) {
				logger.logp(Level.SEVERE, "SessionController", "evict2ndLevelCache", "Error evicting 2nd level hibernate cache entities: ", e);
			}
		}
	
	
##	Entity is fetched very first time

-	Entity is not present in either 1st or 2nd level cache so, it is fetched from database

			DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getEntityFetchCount());           //Prints 1
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getSecondLevelCacheHitCount());   //Prints 0
		 
-	Output: 

			1 0

##	Entity is fetched second time

-	Entity is present in first level cache so, it is fetched from there. No need to go to second level cache	

			
			/Entity is fecthed very first time
			DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//fetch the department entity again
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getEntityFetchCount());           //Prints 1
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getSecondLevelCacheHitCount());   //Prints 0
	

-	Output: 

			1 0	
		
		
		
##	Entity is evicted from first level cache and fetched again

-	First time entity is fetched from database. Which cause it store in 1st and 2nd level cache
-	Second load call fetched from first level cache
-	Then we evicted entity from 1st level cache
-	So third load() call goes to second level cache and getSecondLevelCacheHitCount() returns 1

			//Entity is fecthed very first time
			DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//fetch the department entity again
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//Evict from first level cache
			session.evict(department);
						 
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getEntityFetchCount());           //Prints 1
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getSecondLevelCacheHitCount());   //Prints 1
		
		
-	Output:
		
			1 1	
		
		
		
##	Access second level cache from another session

-	When another session created from same session factory try to get entity, it is successfully looked up in second level cache and no database call is made

			//Entity is fecthed very first time
			DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//fetch the department entity again
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			//Evict from first level cache
			session.evict(department);
						 
			department = (DepartmentEntity) session.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			department = (DepartmentEntity) anotherSession.load(DepartmentEntity.class, new Integer(1));
			System.out.println(department.getName());
			 
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getEntityFetchCount());           //Prints 1
			System.out.println(HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getStatistics().getSecondLevelCacheHitCount());   //Prints 2
			 
-	Output:
