#	Hibernate One to One Mapping with Annotation 


-	OneToOne Mapping defines relationship b/w entities
-	Hibernate supports OneToOne mapping in 3 ways
-	OneToOne Mapping with an example b/w AccountEntity and EmployeeEntity

	-	Each Employee can have one account. Similarly, an account will be associated with one employee only

## Various OneToOne supported techniques

-	JoinColumn:  A foreign key column in one of the tables
-	JoinTable: 	Third table to store mapping b/w first two tables
-	SharedPrimaryKey: ommon primary key value in both the tables


##	1. Hibernate one to one mapping with foreign key association


-	In this kind of association, a foreign key column is created in owner entity
-	For example, if we make EmployeeEntity as an owner, then a extra column "ACCOUNT_ID" will be created in Employee table
-	This column will store the foreign key for Account table and maintains relationship b/w the Employee and Account tables

![Hibernate-OneToOne mapping with foreign key association](https://howtodoinjava.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/foreign-key-association-one-to-one.png)


-	To make this association, we need to refer Account entity in EmployeeEntity class as follow:
-	EmployeeEntity.java: 

				@Entity	
				@Table(name="Employee")
				public class EmployeeEntity {
						
					
					OneToOne(cascade= CascadeType.ALL)		
					@JoinColumn(name="ACCOUNT_ID")
					public AccountEntity account;
				
				}

			
-	@JoinColumn looks similar to @Column annotation
-	@JoinColumn has one more parameters called referencedColumnName
	-	This parameter refers to the column in the targeted entity that will be used in the join
	
	
-	No @JoinColumn:

	-	If no @JoinColumn is declared on the owner side, the defaults apply
	-	A join column(s) will be created in the owner table
	-	And its name will concatenation of Owner Table Column name _(underscore) and Owned table column name
	
	
-	Bidirectional relationship:
	
	-	In bidirectional relationship, one of the sides (and only one) has to be the owner
	-	The owner is responsible for the  maintaining the association column(s) update
	-	To declare that other side is not responsible for the relationship maintenance, the attribute mappedBy must be used at other(non-owner) end of the relationship
	-	‘mappedBy’ refers to the property name of the association on the owner side
	
	
-	AccountEntity.java
			
			
			public class AccountEntity {
				
				@OneToOne(mappedBy = "account")
				public EmployeeEntity employee;
			
			
			}

-	Above “mappedBy” attribute declares that it is dependent on owner entity for mapping

-	TestForeignKeyAssociation.java:


				public class TestForeignKeyAssociation 
				{
		 
					public static void main(String[] args) {
						Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
						session.beginTransaction();
				 
						AccountEntity account = new AccountEntity();
						account.setAccountNumber("123-345-65454");
				 
						// Add new Employee object
						EmployeeEntity emp = new EmployeeEntity();
						emp.setEmail("demo-user@mail.com");
						emp.setFirstName("demo");
						emp.setLastName("user");
						emp.setAccount(account);
						
						// Save Account
						session.saveOrUpdate(account);
						
						// Save Employee
						session.saveOrUpdate(emp);
				 
						session.getTransaction().commit();
						HibernateUtil.shutdown();
					}
				}

-	Console Output:
		
			Hibernate: insert into ACCOUNT (ACC_NUMBER) values (?)
			Hibernate: insert into Employee (ACCOUNT_ID, EMAIL, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
				
				
##	2. Hibernate one to one mapping with common join table

![Hibernate-OneToOne mapping with common join table](https://howtodoinjava.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/join-table-one-to-one-mapping.png)


-	@JoinTable is the main annotation to be used in technique
-	This annotation is used to define a new table name (mandatory) and foreign keys from both of the tables	

-	EmployeeEntity.java:

			@Entity
			@Table("Employee")
			public class EmployeeEntity {
			
				@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
				@JoinTable(name="EMPLOYEE_ACCCOUNT", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="EMPLOYEE_ID"),
				inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="ACCOUNT_ID"))
				private AccountEntity account;
				
			}
-	@JoinTable annotation is used in the EmployeeEntity class			

			
-	AccountEntity.java:
			
			@Entity
			@Table("Account")
			public class AccountEntity {
				
				@OneToOne(mappedBy = "account")
				public EmployeeEntity employee;
			
			
			}			


-	It tells Hibernate that a new table EMPLOYEE_ACCOUNT should be created with two columns EMPLOYEE_ID (primary key of EMPLOYEE table) and ACCOUNT_ID (primary key of ACCOUNT table)

	-	Console Output:

			Hibernate: insert into ACCOUNT (ACC_NUMBER) values (?)
			Hibernate: insert into Employee (EMAIL, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) values (?, ?, ?)
			Hibernate: insert into EMPLOYEE_ACCCOUNT (ACCOUNT_ID, EMPLOYEE_ID) values (?, ?)
			
			
##	3. Hibernate one to one mapping with shared primary key

-	In this technique, hibernate will use a common primary key value in both the tables
-	This way primary key of EmployeeEntity can be safely assumed that it will primary key of AccountEntity also.
	
	![Hibernate-OneToOne mapping with shared primary key](https://howtodoinjava.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/shared-primary-key-one-to-one.png)
	
-	@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn is the main annotation to be used to have the shared-primary-key-one-to-one

-	EmployeeEntity.java:

				@Entity
				@Table("Employee")
				public class EmployeeEntity 
				{
					@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
					@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
					private AccountEntity account;

				}				
-	In AccountEntity side, it will remain dependent on owner entity for the mapping
					
-	AccountEntity.java:
		
				@Entity
				@Table("Account")
				public class AccountEntity 
				{
					OneToOne(mappedBy="account", cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
					private EmployeeEntity employee;	
						
				}		
				

-	Console Output:

		Hibernate: insert into ACCOUNT (ACC_NUMBER) values (?)
		Hibernate: insert into Employee (ACCOUNT_ID, EMAIL, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
