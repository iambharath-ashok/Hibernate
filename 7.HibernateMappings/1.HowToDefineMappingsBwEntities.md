#	Hibernate – How to Define Association Mappings between Entities

-	Hibernate identify java objects as persistent only when they are annotated with certain annotations; otherwise they are treated as simple plain java objects with no direct relation to database
-	Association can be unidirectional or bidirectional


##	Entities and Their Associations

-	Foreign Key Association:

	-	Entities can contain references to other entities:
		-	Either directly as an embedded property or field, or indirectly via a collection of some sort (arrays, sets, lists, etc.)
	-	Association b/w entities are represented using foreign key relationships in the underlying tables

-	Unidirectional and Bidirectional
		
	-	When only one of the pair of entities contains a reference to the other, the association is unidirectional
	-	If the association is mutual, then it is referred to as bidirectional
	-	A common mistake when designing entity models, is trying to make all associations bidirectional


-	mappedBy:

	-	By doing changes only to one end of the relationship will result in any updates to the foreign key
	-	Hibernate allows us to do this by marking one end of the association as being managed by the other
	-	In hibernate mapping associations:
		-	one (and only one) of the participating classes is referred to as “managing the relationship” and other one is called “managed by” using ‘mappedBy’ property
		-	We should not make both ends of association “managing the relationship”

-	Cascading:
		
	-	Hibernate allows that, changes made to one end of association will result in changes to the database
	-	Hibernate doesn't allow to reflect changes in the other end automatically 
	-	We must use cascading capabilities for doing so
	

##	Understanding Associations with Example


-	Associations with an example b/w two entities: EmployeeEntity and AccountEntity
-	Entities wil have one-to-one association b/w them


-	EmployeeEntity.java:

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "Employee")
			public class EmployeeEntity implements Serializable
			{
			   private static final long serialVersionUID = -1798070786993154676L;
			   @Id
			   @Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
			   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
			   private Integer           employeeId;
			   @Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
			   private String            firstName;
			   @Column(name = "LAST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
			   private String            lastName;
			 
			   //We will define the association here
			   AccountEntity             account;
			 
			   //Getters and Setters are not shown for brevity
			}
				
	
-	AccountEntity.java

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "Account")
			public class AccountEntity implements Serializable
			{
			   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
			 
			   @Id
			   @Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
			   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
			   private Integer           accountId;
			 
			   @Column(name = "ACC_NO", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
			   private String            accountNumber;
			 
			   //We will define the association here
			   EmployeeEntity            employee;
			 
			   //Getters and Setters are not shown for brevity
			}


			
##	Scenario 1) Association managed by both entities

-	In this type of association, we will define the association as below using @OneToOne annotation.

		
				//Inside EmployeeEntity.java
				@OneToOne
				AccountEntity       account;
				 
				//Inside AccountEntity.java
				@OneToOne
				EmployeeEntity      employee;
			
			
-	With above association, both ends are managing the association 
-	So both entities must be updated with information of each other using setter methods defined in entity java files
-	If we fail to do so, we will not be able to fetch the associated entity information and it will be returned as null


				public class TestHibernate
				{
				   public static void main(String[] args)
				   {
					  Session sessionOne = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
					  sessionOne.beginTransaction();
				 
					  // Create new Employee object
					  EmployeeEntity emp = new EmployeeEntity();
					  emp.setFirstName("Lokesh");
					  emp.setLastName("Gupta");
				 
					  // Create new Employee object
					  AccountEntity acc = new AccountEntity();
					  acc.setAccountNumber("DUMMY_ACCOUNT");
					  emp.setAccount(acc);
					  //acc.setEmployee(emp);  // Here we are not updating the account entity with Employee Entity 
												// so that Employee Entity will not be able retrieve from the Account Entity
				 
					  sessionOne.save(acc);
					  sessionOne.save(emp);
					  sessionOne.getTransaction().commit();
				 
					  Integer genEmpId = emp.getEmployeeId();
					  Integer genAccId  = acc.getAccountId();
				 
					  Session sessionTwo = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
					  sessionTwo.beginTransaction();
					  EmployeeEntity employee = (EmployeeEntity) sessionTwo.get(EmployeeEntity.class, genEmpId);
					  AccountEntity account = (AccountEntity) sessionTwo.get(AccountEntity.class, genAccId);
				 
					  System.out.println(employee.getEmployeeId());
					  System.out.println(employee.getAccount().getAccountNumber());
					  System.out.println(account.getAccountId());
					  System.out.println(account.getEmployee().getEmployeeId());
				 
					  HibernateUtil.shutdown();
				   }
				}

-	Console Output:

				 
			Hibernate: insert into Account (ACC_NO, employee_ID, ID) values (?, ?, ?)
			Hibernate: insert into Employee (account_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ID) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
			Hibernate: select employeeen0_.ID as ID1_1_0_, employeeen0_.account_ID as account_4_1_0_, employeeen0_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_0_,
						employeeen0_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_0_, accountent1_.ID as ID1_0_1_, accountent1_.ACC_NO as ACC_NO2_0_1_,
						accountent1_.employee_ID as employee3_0_1_, employeeen2_.ID as ID1_1_2_, employeeen2_.account_ID as account_4_1_2_,
						employeeen2_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_2_, employeeen2_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_2_ from Employee
						employeeen0_ left outer join Account accountent1_ on employeeen0_.account_ID=accountent1_.ID

			DUMMY_ACCOUNT
			10
			Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
				at com.howtodoinjava.test.TestHibernate.main(TestHibernate.java:43)
				
				
-	We 	ahve commented the line “acc.setEmployee(emp);” and thus not set the employee entity inside account entity, so we will be not able to get it.	
-	 Fromt the insert Query we can see that both tables have foreign key association with column names employee_ID and account_ID respectively
-	It’s example of circular dependency in data and can easily bring down your application any time
-	To correctly store above relationship, we must un-comment the line “acc.setEmployee(emp);“
-	After uncommenting the line, we will be able to store and retrieve the association as desired 
	-	But still there will be circular dependency b/w tables
	
	
-	After uncommenting the line, output will be like below:
		
		
			Hibernate: insert into Account (ACC_NO, employee_ID, ID) values (?, ?, ?)
			Hibernate: insert into Employee (account_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ID) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
			Hibernate: update Account set ACC_NO=?, employee_ID=? where ID=?
			Hibernate: select employeeen0_.ID as ID1_1_0_, employeeen0_.account_ID as account_4_1_0_, employeeen0_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_0_,
						employeeen0_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_0_, accountent1_.ID as ID1_0_1_, accountent1_.ACC_NO as ACC_NO2_0_1_,
						accountent1_.employee_ID as employee3_0_1_, employeeen2_.ID as ID1_1_2_, employeeen2_.account_ID as account_4_1_2_,
						employeeen2_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_2_, employeeen2_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_2_ from Employee
						employeeen0_ left outer join Account accountent1_ on employeeen0_.account_ID=accountent1_.ID
						left outer join Employee employeeen2_ on accountent1_.employee_ID=employeeen2_.ID where employeeen0_.ID=?

			DUMMY_ACCOUNT

##	Scenario 2) Association managed by single entity


-	Let’s say association is managed by EmployeeEntity then the annotations in both entity will look like below.


			//Inside EmployeeEntity.java
			@OneToOne(cascade= CascadeType.ALL, fetch= FetchType.LAZY)
			AccountEntity       account;
			 
			//Inside AccountEntity.java
			@OneToOne (mappedBy = "account")
			EmployeeEntity      employee;
			
			
-	To tell hibernate that association is managed by EmployeeEntity, we will add ‘mappedBy‘ attribute inside AccountEntity to make it manageable		
-	We will have to set the association only once using “emp.setAccount(acc);”	
-	Employee entity will  manage the relationship
-	AccountEntity dos not need to know anything explicitly
		
				Session sessionOne = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				sessionOne.beginTransaction();
				 
				// Create new Employee object
				EmployeeEntity emp = new EmployeeEntity();
				emp.setFirstName("Lokesh");
				emp.setLastName("Gupta");
				 
				// Create new Employee object
				AccountEntity acc = new AccountEntity();
				acc.setAccountNumber("DUMMY_ACCOUNT");
				emp.setAccount(acc);
				//acc.setEmployee(emp); // No need to set this 
				 
				sessionOne.save(acc);
				sessionOne.save(emp);
				sessionOne.getTransaction().commit();
				 
				Integer genEmpId = emp.getEmployeeId();
				Integer genAccId  = acc.getAccountId();
				 
				Session sessionTwo = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				sessionTwo.beginTransaction();
				EmployeeEntity employee = (EmployeeEntity) sessionTwo.get(EmployeeEntity.class, genEmpId);
				AccountEntity account = (AccountEntity) sessionTwo.get(AccountEntity.class, genAccId);
				 
				System.out.println(employee.getEmployeeId());
				System.out.println(employee.getAccount().getAccountNumber());
				System.out.println(account.getAccountId());
				System.out.println(account.getEmployee().getEmployeeId());
				
				HibernateUtil.shutdown();
-	Output:
		
		
		Hibernate: insert into Account (ACC_NO, ID) values (?, ?)
		Hibernate: insert into Employee (account_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ID) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
		Hibernate: select employeeen0_.ID as ID1_1_0_, employeeen0_.account_ID as account_4_1_0_, employeeen0_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_0_,
		employeeen0_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_0_, accountent1_.ID as ID1_0_1_, accountent1_.ACC_NO as ACC_NO2_0_1_ from Employee employeeen0_
		left outer join Account accountent1_ on employeeen0_.account_ID=accountent1_.ID where employeeen0_.ID=?
		Hibernate: select employeeen0_.ID as ID1_1_1_, employeeen0_.account_ID as account_4_1_1_, employeeen0_.FIRST_NAME as FIRST_NA2_1_1_,
		employeeen0_.LAST_NAME as LAST_NAM3_1_1_, accountent1_.ID as ID1_0_0_, accountent1_.ACC_NO as ACC_NO2_0_0_ from Employee employeeen0_
		left outer join Account accountent1_ on employeeen0_.account_ID=accountent1_.ID where employeeen0_.account_ID=?
		 
		20
		DUMMY_ACCOUNT
		10
		20
				
				
-	In the above code we can see that no need to tell anything to account entity (‘acc.setEmployee(emp)‘ is commented)
-	Employee entity is managing the association both ways		
-	We can also notice from the logs that we have only one account_id column in the Employee Table
-	Also there will be no circular dependency 




## How to Define Associations for Various Mappings

-	In OneToOne mapping we can define the ownership of association b/w either end of the entities
-	But in case of ManyToMany mapping there will be strict rules on defining the ownership of associations
	
TYPE OF ASSOCIATION	| OPTIONS/ USAGE
---------------------|----------------
One-to-one	| Either end can be made the owner, but one (and only one) of them should be; if you don’t specify this, you will end up with a circular dependency
One-to-many	| The many end must be made the owner of the association
Many-to-one	| This is the same as the one-to-many relationship viewed from the opposite perspective, so the same rule applies: the many end must be made the owner of the association
Many-to-many |	Either end of the association can be made the owner



-	Association ownership is mainly concerned about the management of foreign keys in the database
