# Hibernate Interview Questions

##	What is Hibernate?

-	Hibernate is a ORM tool, that maps java objects to DB tables
-	Hibernates takes care doing db related operations like generating queries, managing cache, connection pooling
-	Developers can focus more on business logic 


##	 Is hibernate better than JDBC?

-	Hibernate uses JDBC behind the scenes to query DB's
-	But the choice of hibernate over JDBC is due to DB independence and higher performance
-	Not writing DB specific queries

##	What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC

-	Reduces lot of boiler plate code
-	Caching improves performance
-	Lazy Loading or On demand loading
-	Relationship management and provides code for mapping an object to the data
-	The developer is free from writing code to load/store data into the database

##	Why do we need hibernate in Java?

-	So with JDBC, mapping between Java objects and database tables is done manually
-	Hibernate reduces lines of code by maintaining object-table mapping itself and returns result to application in form of Java objects
-	Hibernate, with Transparent Persistence, cache is set to application work space

##	What is the use of ORM in Java?

-	ORM allows us to use java objects as representation of a relational database
-	It maps Java Objects to Tables in Relational DB's
-	In applicationk, we can directly work on the JPA entities instead of Tables and its columns rows


##	 What is the difference between JPA and Hibernate?

-	JPA is a specification of Persistence providers like Hibernate Eclipse link, top link
-	JPA provides the API's that developers can use in application and its implementation will be provided by one of the vendors

##	Difference between get() vs load() method in Hibernate?

-	The key difference between the get() and load() method is that:
	-	Session.load(): It will always return a “proxy” without hitting the database. In Hibernate, proxy is an object with the given identifier value, its properties are not initialized yet, it just look like a temporary fake object. If no row found , it will throws an ObjectNotFoundException
	-	load() will throw an exception if an object with id passed to them is not found
	-	but get() will return null if entity not found
-	Another important difference is that load can return proxy without hitting the database unless required (when you access any attribute other than id) 
-	But get() always go to the database, so sometimes using load() can be faster than the get() method

##	 What is N+1 SELECT problem in Hibernate?

-	N+1 problem is hibernate is due to lazy fetch or on demand fetching strategy
-	Hibernate will end up executing N+1 queries to populate a collection of N elements

- 	For ex: If there are list of N items and each item depends on Collection of Bid Objects 
	-	In order find the highest bid for each item hibernate will fire 1 query to load all the items 
	- 	And N subsequent queries to load highest bid for each item
-	So in order to find the highest bid for each item your application ends up firing N+1 queries



##	What are some strategies to solve the N+1 SELECT problem in Hibernate?

-	Some strategies to solve the N+1 problem:
	-	1) pre-fetching in batches, this will reduce the N+1 problem to N/K + 1 problem where  K is the size of the batch
	-	2) subselect fetching strategy
	-	3) disabling lazy loading
	
	
##	What is the difference between save() and persist() method in Hibernate?
![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0FvMOmnE7ec/Vrm6gpn-yvI/AAAAAAAAEvA/fb9ZfeJL9Uw/s640/Difference%2Bbetween%2Bsave%2Bvs%2Bpersist%2Bin%2BHibernate.png)
-	The main difference between save() and persist() method is that:

	-	save returns a Serializable object while return type of the persist() method is void, so it doesn't return anything

##	 What is the requirement for a Java object to become a Hibernate entity object?

-	It should not be final and must provide a default, no-argument constructor, better to override hashcode and equals method


##	What are different types of caches available in Hibernate?

-	First level cache or session cache -> enabled by default
-	Second level cache - not enabled by default -> needs to enable manually:
-	Second level cache will be maintained by Session Factory instance

	-	Hibernate by default ships with EHcache
	-	hibernate.use_second_level_cache is the property to enable the second level cache
	
##	What is the difference between the first and second level cache in Hibernate?


-	The first level cache is maintained at Session level while the second level cache is maintained at a SessionFactory level and shared by all sessions

##	What is the use of Session in hibernate?

-	Session is main the main interface in Hibernate
-	Session will be obtained from Hibernate Session Factory Instance
-	Session Manages the Life cycle of the entities
-	Session also manages the First Level cache of entities in Hibernate
-	Session will be used to the transaction instance

##	 Is hibernate Sessionfactory Singleton?

-	SessionFactory is also thread safe so only one thread can execute at a time its code
-	The instance of sessionFactory is heavyweighted because it contains connection, hibernate configuration, mapping files so if we create more number of instance of sessionFactory then your code becomes very heavy


##	 Does SessionFactory thread-safe in Hibernate?

-	SessionFactory is both Immutable and thread-safe and only one instance will be created for entire Hibernate application
-	It is used to create a Session object and it also provides caching by storing SQL queries stored by multiple session


##	 Is session is thread safe in hibernate?

-	No, Session object is not thread-safe in Hibernate and intended to be used with-in single thread in the application
-	SessionFactory in Hibernates is a concept of a single datastore and is threadsafe so that many threads can access it concurrently and request for sessions and immutable cache of compiled mappings for a single database.
-	 Why to make session object thread safe if we already have a SessionFactory(immutable) object.

##	What is different between Session and SessionFactory in Hibernate?

-	The main difference between Session and SessionFactory is that the Session Instance is a single-threaded, short-lived object
-	While SessionFactory Instance is Immutable and shared by all Session.
-	SessionFactory is threadsafe so that many threads can access it concurrently and request for sessions
-	SessionFactory also lives until the Hibernate is running. Sessions are opened by a SessionFactory and then are closed when all work is complete.
-	Another difference between Session and SessionFactory is that Session provides first level cache while SessionFactory provides the Second level cache which will shared by all the sessions

##	What is criteria in hibernate?

-	In Hibernate, the Criteria API helps us build criteria query objects dynamically 
-	Criteria is a another technique of data retrieval apart from HQL and native SQL queries
-	The primary advantage of the Criteria API is that it is intuitively designed to manipulate data without using any hard-coded SQL statements

##	What is criterion query in hibernate?

-	Criteria is a API for retrieving entities by composing Criterion objects also known as Criterion query
-	This is a very convenient approach for functionality like "search", filter, restrictions, order by, joins etc, group
-	Main advantage of Criteria Query is that, we will get compile time errors 


				List books = session.createCriteria(Book.class)
				.add(Restrictions.like("name", "java%") )
				.add(Restrictions.like("published_year", "2015"))
				.addOrder(Order.asc("name") )
				.list();

				
##	What are other ORM frameworks? Any alternative of Hibernate?

-	toplink, eclipse link etc


##	What is the difference between save() and saveOrUpdate() method of Hibernate?


-	Though both save() and saveOrUpdate() method is used to store an object into Database
- 	the key difference between them is that save can only INSERT records but saveOrUpdate() can either INSERT or UPDATE records


##	 What is difference between getCurrentSession() and openSession() in Hibernate? 

-	getCurrentSession():
	-	SessionFactory.getCurrentSession() returns a session bound to a context – we don’t need to close this explicitly
	-	we can access that session anywhere else by using the SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()
-	openSession() will create new session irrespective of current session 
	-	SessionFactory.openSession() always creates a new session that we have to close once we are done with the operations


##	What is Hibernate Query Language (HQL)?

-	Hibernate query language, HQL is an object-oriented equivalent to SQL
-	HQL operates on the entities and its properties instead of tables and columns
-	It allows us to query, store, update, and retrieve objects from a database without using SQL
-	Hibernate will convert the HQL to SQL at runtime
-	Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns perform action on database


##	When do you use merge() and update() in Hibernate?

- 	We should use update(entity) method if we are sure that entity is not in persistent state in any of the session
-	Use merge() if you want to merge your modifications at any time without considering the state of the session


##	The difference between sorted and ordered collection in Hibernate?


-	The main difference between sorted and ordered collection is that:
	-	Sorted collection sort the data in JVM's heap memory using Java's collection framework sorting methods
	-	While the ordered collection is sorted using order by clause in the database itself
	

##	How do you log SQL queries issued by the Hibernate framework in Java application?

-	We can use the show_sql property to log SQL queries issued by the Hibernate framework
-	In hibernate.cfg.xml file
	
			<property name=”hibernate.show_sql”> true </property>


			
##	What are the three states of a Hibernate Persistence object can be?

-	Transient
-	Persistent
-	Detached 
-	Removed


##	What are the collection types in Hibernate?

-	Hibernate collections types are:
java.util.List.java.util.Set.java.util.SortedSet.java.util.Map.java.util.SortedMap.java.util.Collection.or write the implementation of org.hibernate.usertype.UserCollectionType

##	How to implement Joins in Hibernate?


-	Using HQL we can implement joins in hibernate
-	HQL Joins – HQL supports inner join, left outer join, right outer join and full join
- 	For example, select e.name, a.city from Employee e INNER JOIN e.address a . In this query, Employee class should have a variable named address




##	What is the difference between the transient, persistent and detached state in Hibernate? 


-	https://github.com/iambharath-ashok/Hibernate/blob/master/1.HibernateCore/1.HibernateArchitecture/2.HibernateEntityLifeCycleStates.md 


##	Which cache is used by Session Object in Hibernate? First level or second level cache?

- 	A Session object uses the first-level cache




##	 What are the fetching strategies supported by hibernate?

-	Fetch strategies can be declared in the O/R mapping metadata(mappings b/w Objects), or over-ridden by a particular HQL or Criteria query
-	Hibernate defines the following fetching strategies:


	-	Join fetching
	-	Select fetching
	-	Subselect fetching
	-	Batch fetching
	-	Immediate fetching
	-	Lazy collection fetching
	-	“Extra-lazy” collection fetching
	-	Proxy fetching
	-	“No-proxy” fetching
	-	Lazy attribute fetching




##	What are the configuration files in hibernate?

-	Hibernate also requires a set of configuration settings related to database and other related parameters like:

	-	DB URL
	-	DB Dialect
	-	User Name
	-	Password
	-	DB Driver Class
	
-	All such information is usually supplied as a standard Java properties file called hibernate.properties, or as an XML file named hibernate.cfg.xml

##	What is the use of dialect in hibernate?

-	Dialect means “the variant of a language”
-	Hibernate, as we know, is database agnostic (Independent)
-	Hibernate can work with multiple databases like MySQL, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, HSQL, H2
-	However, databases have proprietary extensions/native SQL variations, and set/sub-set of SQL standard implementations
	-	DB will have its own datatypes and syntaxes, its own way of SQL queries
-	 Therefore at some point hibernate has to use database specific SQL

##	What is hibernate proxy and how it helps in lazy loading?

-	A proxy is a subclass implemented at runtime
-	Hibernate creates a proxy	(a subclass of the class being fetched) instead of querying the database directly, and this proxy will load the “real” object from the database whenever one of its methods is called


##	What is the difference between lazy and eager loading in hibernate?

-	In eager loading all the associations will be loaded eagerly on the parent associations
-	In lazy loading, child instance or mapped associations are loaded only when one of their properties are called
-	In lazy loading, hibernate will create a proxy on the associated instance to avoid the query execution 

##	What is lazy fetching in Hibernate?

-	Lazy fetching decides whether to load child objects while loading the Parent Object
-	We can instruct hibernate to do lazy fetching using mappings annotations like @OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
-	By default the lazy loading of the child objects is true in one to many relationships.


##	How does Hibernate proxy work?

-	Hibernate lazy initialization will create a proxy object for the association in order to avoid db call
-	Hibernate achieves lazy initialization through proxy patter
-	When a method is invoked on the proxy instance, Hibernate will fetch the data from the column and populate the object
-	This is the proxy mechanism
-	To add this new behavior (the loading of the data when a method is invoked)
- 	Hibernate will implement proxy by creating a dynamic subclass of Person using CGLib and add the desired functionality


##	 Is Hibernate configuration file mandatory?

-	No, it’s not mandatory to use hibernate.cfg.xml. Just don’t use .configure()


##	What does hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto create means?

-	Automatically validates or exports schema DDL to the database based on the entities when SessionFactory is created
-	With create-drop , the database schema will be dropped when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly
-	Values for hbm2ddl property:

	-	validate: validate the schema, makes no changes to the database.
	-	update: update the schema.
	-	create: creates the schema, destroying previous data.
	-	create-drop: drop the schema when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly, typically when the application is stopped.



##	What is the use of projection in hibernate?

-	Hibernate Projections are used in order to query only a subset of the attributes of an entity or group of entities
-	Projections will be used with Criteria Query
-	We can also use Projections to specify distinct clauses and aggregate functions like max , sum and so on. Like modifying the select clause in an SQL query


##	What is Lazyinitializationexception in hibernate?

-	Indicates access to unfetched data outside of a session context. For example, when an uninitialized proxy or collection is accessed after the session was closed

##	What are the different cascade types in hibernate?

-	PERSIST
-	ALL
-	NONE
-	REFRESH
-	MERGE
-	REMOVE
-	DETACH or EVICT

##	What are the different cascade types in hibernate?

-	Hibernate Bag is a java collection that stores elements without caring about the sequencing, but allow duplicate elements in the list. A bag is a random grouping of the objects in the list


##	What is the use of Mappedby in hibernate?

-	MappedBy attribute is used to hibernate/jpa that which side owns the ownership of relationships
-	Owner table will have column to maintain relationship to another end table 
-	Without mappedBy attribute, the relationship is external and Hibernate/JPA need to create another table to store the relationship


##	What is inverse true in hibernate?

-	The real meaning is that it defines which side is the parent or the relationship owner for the two entities (parent or child). 
-	Hence, inverse=”true” in a Hibernate mapping shows that this class (the one with this definition) is the relationship owner; while the other class is the child


##	What is a bidirectional relationship?

-	In a bidirectional relationship, each entity has a relationship field or property that refers to the other entity
-	Through the relationship field or property, an entity class’s code can access its related object


##	What is the dirty checking in hibernate?

-	Hibernate allows dirty checking feature.
-	All persistent objects are monitored by hibernate
-	Hibernate detects which entities have been modified and then calls update statements on all updated objects
-	The process of updating the changed object is called automatic dirty checking
