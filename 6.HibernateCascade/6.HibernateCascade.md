#	Hibernate JPA Cascade Types

-	Cascade Type is used to map associations b/w entities
-	Cascade Type is used to save the mapped entity whenever relationship owner entity got updated or deleted or inserted
-	To enable Cascade Type we had to use CascadeType Attribute on the Association Annotations
	
	
##	How JPA Cascade Types Work?

-	Take a scenario where an Employee can have multiple Accounts; but one account must be associated with only one employee
-	Here Employee Entity is the owner and manages the cascade operations

-	EmployeeEntity.java

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "Employee")
			public class EmployeeEntity implements Serializable
			{
				private static final long serialVersionUID = -1798070786993154676L;
				@Id
				@Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
				private Integer           employeeId;
				@Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
				private String            firstName;
				@Column(name = "LAST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
				private String            lastName;
			 
				@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
				@JoinColumn(name="EMPLOYEE_ID")
				private Set<AccountEntity> accounts;
			 
				//Getters and Setters Ommited
			}
			
			
			
-	AccountEntity.java

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "Account")
			public class AccountEntity implements Serializable
			{
				private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
				@Id
				@Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
				@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
				private Integer           accountId;
				@Column(name = "ACC_NO", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
				private String            accountNumber;
			 
				@OneToOne (mappedBy="accounts",  fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
				private EmployeeEntity employee;
			 
			}
			
-	“cascade=CascadeType.ALL” on EmployeeEntity defines that any change happened on EmployeeEntity must cascade to AccountEntity as well
-	If we save an employee, then all associated accounts will also be saved into database
- 	If we delete an Employee then all accounts associated with that Employee also be deleted		

-	If we only want to cascade only save operations but not delete operation. Then we need to clearly specify it using below code	


			@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
			@JoinColumn(name="EMPLOYEE_ID")
			private Set<AccountEntity> accounts;
			

-	Now only when save() or persist() methods are called using employee instance then only accounts will be persisted
-	If any other method is called on session, it’s effect will not affect/cascade to accounts


##	JPA Cascade Types

-	CascadeType.PERSIST : cascade type presist means that save() or persist() operations cascade to related entities.
-	CascadeType.MERGE : cascade type merge means that related entities are merged when the owning entity is merged.
-	CascadeType.REFRESH : cascade type refresh does the same thing for the refresh() operation.
-	CascadeType.REMOVE : cascade type remove removes all related entities association with this setting when the owning entity is deleted.
-	CascadeType.DETACH : cascade type detach detaches all related entities if a “manual detach” occurs.
-	CascadeType.ALL : cascade type all is shorthand for all of the above cascade operations.

	
	-	There is no default cascade type in JPA. By default no operations are cascaded.


## Array of CascadeTypes

-	We can give array of Cascade Type operations
-	Below cascade configuration option accepts an array of CascadeTypes; thus, to include only refreshes and merges in the cascade operation for a One-to-Many relationship


			@OneToMany(cascade={CascadeType.REFRESH, CascadeType.MERGE}, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
			@JoinColumn(name="EMPLOYEE_ID")
			private Set<AccountEntity> accounts;
			
	


##	Hibernate Cascade Types

-	Apart from JPA provided cascade types, there is one more cascading operation that hibernate	provides called “orphan removal“
-	This removes an owned object from the database when it’s removed from its owning relationship
-	orphan removal means that all the records that are not in relationship with his owner table will removed from the child table

-	For Ex: 

	-	Employee may have set of different accounts
	-	One the Account from his account set has been removed relationship b/w them
	-	That account entity which is not associated with any other Employee on database(i.e orphan)
	-	Those kind of orphan records will deleted automatically

	
-	EmployeeEntity.java:

			@Entity
			@Table(name = "Employee")
			public class EmployeeEntity implements Serializable
			{
				private static final long serialVersionUID = -1798070786993154676L;
				@Id
				@Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
				private Integer           employeeId;
				@Column(name = "FIRST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
				private String            firstName;
				@Column(name = "LAST_NAME", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
				private String            lastName;
			 
				@OneToMany(orphanRemoval = true, mappedBy = "employee")
				private Set<AccountEntity> accounts;
				
			}

			
-	AccountEntity.java

		@Entity (name = "Account")
		@Table(name = "Account")
		public class AccountEntity implements Serializable
		{
			private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
			@Id
			@Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
			@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
			private Integer           accountId;
			@Column(name = "ACC_NO", unique = false, nullable = false, length = 100)
			private String            accountNumber;
		 
			@ManyToOne
			private EmployeeEntity employee;
		}

				  System.out.println("Step 3 : " + employee1.getAccounts().size());
				   
				  //Verify there are 2 accounts in Account table
				  Query query = sessionTwo.createQuery("from Account a");
				  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
				  List<AccountEntity> accounts = query.list();
				  System.out.println("Step 4 : " + accounts.size());
				   
				  sessionTwo.close();
				   
				  HibernateUtil.shutdown();
			   } 
				
			   private static void setupTestData(){
				  Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();

				  //Create Employee
				  EmployeeEntity emp = new EmployeeEntity();
