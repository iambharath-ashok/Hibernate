#	Hibernate Query Language 


-	HQL is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties
-	Main difference b/w HQL and SQL is that:
	-	HQL work on Entities and it's properties
	-	SQL works on Tables and its rows, columns
	
-	HQL is superset of JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
-	 A JPQL query is a valid HQL query, but not all HQL queries are valid JPQL queries


-	HQL Grammar and Syntax:

	-	HQL is a language with its own syntax and grammar
	-	It is written as strings, like “from Product p“
	-	HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries at runtime

-	Hibernator’s query facilities do not allow us to alter the database structure
	-	We can alter only data inside tables



##	HQL Syntax


-	1. HQL Update Statement

	-	hql update statement example:
		
				Query query = session.createQuery("update EmployeeEntity e set e.name=:name where e.id=:id");
				query.setString("name", "Bharath The Great");
				query.setInteger("id", 7);
				int modification = query.executeUpdate();
			
			
-	2. HQL Delete Statement

	-	hql delete statement example:

			
				Query query = session.createQuery("delete from EmployeeEntity e where e.id=:id");
				query.setInteger("id", 0);
				int rowsDeleted = query.executeUpdate();
				
				
-	3. HQL Insert Statement

	-	HQL INSERT cannot be used to directly insert arbitrary entities
	-	it can only be used to insert entities constructed from information obtained from SELECT queries

	-	hql insert statement syntax:
	
				INSERT
				   INTO path ( property [, ...])
				   select
				   
	-	hql insert statement example:
				
				Query query = session.createQuery("insert into purget_accounts (id, code, status) "+
					"select id, code, status from account a where a.status=:status");
				query.setString("status", "updated");
				int rowsCopied = query.executeUpdate();
				
				

-	4.	 HQL Select Statement
	
	-	An HQL SELECT is used to query the database for classes and their properties
	
	-	1.	HQL – from clause and aliases
	
		-	alias is the important feature of the hibernate
		-	Hibernate allows us to assign aliases to the classes in our query with the as clause
		-	hql alias example:
			
					from Product as p
 
					//or
					 
					from Product as product
					
			-	The 'as' keyword is optional. We can also specify the alias directly after the class name as follows:
			
					from Product product
					
	-	2.	HQL select clause and projection
			
		-	select clause and projection provides more control over the result set than the from clause
		-	If we are interested in particular property in the Entity then we can use that property in the select clause 
		-	we could run a projection query on the products in the database that only returned the names, instead of loading the full object into memory, as follows
		
			
					select product.name from Product product
		
		-	Retrieving multiple properties	
		
					select product.name, product.price from Product product	
					
					
	-	3.	HQL Named Parameters
		
		-	In JDBC, when using query parameters we need to maintain the order, because the parameters are indexed 
		-	Hibernate lets us provide names for the parameters in the HQL query, so we do not need to worry about accidentally moving parameters around in the query
				
					String hql = "from Product where price > :price";
					Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
					query.setDouble("price",25.0);
					List results = query.list();
		
		
	-	4.	HQL – Paging Through the ResultSet
	
		-	Pagination through the result set of a database query is a very common application pattern
		-	The application would be very slow if the web application loaded all of the data into memory
		-	Instead of loading all the objects in memory all at once we can load page wise
		-	There are two methods on the Query interface for paging: setFirstResult() and setMaxResults()
		
			-	setFirstResult() method takes an integer that represents the first row in your result set
			-	setMaxResults() method tells Hibernate to only retrieve a fixed number of objects 
			
					Query query = session.createQuery("from Product");
					query.setFirstResult(1);
					query.setMaxResults(2);
					List results = query.list();
					displayProductsList(results);
					
					
	-	5.	HQL – Get a Unique Result

		-	HQL’s Query interface provides a uniqueResult() method for obtaining just one object from an HQL query
		-	If there is more than one result, then the uniqueResult() method throws a NonUniqueResultException
		-	It's better to use uniqueResult() method with setMaxResults(1) as 1
		
					String hql = "from Product where price>25.0";
					Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
					query.setMaxResults(1);
					Product product = (Product) query.uniqueResult();
					
					
	-	6.	HQL – Sorting Results with the ‘order by’ clause
	
					from Product p where p.price>25.0 order by p.price desc
					
					from Product p order by p.supplier.name asc, p.price asc

					
					
##	HQL Aggregate Methods


-	HQL supports a range of aggregate methods, similar to SQL. They work the same way in HQL as in SQL
-	The difference is that in HQL, aggregate methods apply to the properties of persistent objects
-	We  may use the count(*) syntax to count all the objects in the result set, or count(product.name) to count the number of objects in the result set with a name property

			Select count(*) from ProductEntity p where p.price >:price;
			
			
			
-	avg(property name): The average of a property’s value
-	count(property name or *): The number of times a property occurs in the results
-	max(property name): The maximum value of the property values
-	min(property name): The minimum value of the property values
-	sum(property name): The sum total of the property values	


##	HQL Named Queries


			@NamedQueries({
			@NamedQuery(name = "supplier.findAll", query = "from Supplier s"),
			@NamedQuery(name = "supplier.findByName",
					query = "from Supplier s where s.name=:name"),
			})

-	Executing named query is even simpler:
		
			Query query = session.getNamedQuery("supplier.findAll");
			List<Supplier> suppliers = query.list();
			
			
##	 HQL – Native SQL

-	Hibernate does provide a way to use native SQL statements directly through Hibernate
-	One reason to use native SQL is that our database supports some special features through its dialect of SQL that are not supported in HQL
-	Another reason is that we may want to call stored procedures from your Hibernate application

	-	Hibernate’s native SQL support is the org.hibernate.SQLQuery interface, which extends the org.hibernate.Query interface
	-	We can execute native query with createSQLQuery() method on the Session interface
	
	
				public SQLQuery createSQLQuery(String queryString) throws HibernateException
			
			
	-	Hibernate sql query example
	
				String sql = "select avg(product.price) as avgPrice from Product product";
				SQLQuery query = session.createSQLQuery(sql);
				query.addScalar("avgPrice",Hibernate.DOUBLE);
				List results = query.list();


##	HQL – Enable Logs and Comments


-	The easiest way to see the SQL for a Hibernate HQL query is to enable SQL output in the logs with the “show_sql” property
-	Set this property to true in your hibernate.cfg.xml configuration file
