# Hibernate Named Queries

-	Named queries in hibernate is a technique to group the HQL statements in single location
-	And later we can refer them by some name whenever need to use them
-	It helps largely in code cleanup because these HQL statements are no longer scattered in whole code


## Advantages of Named Queries in Hibernate

-	We can place and manage all the Named Queries that spread across whole application from a Single location
-	Fail fast: Named Queries syntax is checked when session factory is created, making the application fail fast in case of an error
-	Reusable: Same named query can be accessed and used from several places which increase re-usability

	
## Disadvantages of Named Queries

-	Make code less readable and sometimes debugging becomes more hard
-	As we have to locate the actual query definition being executed and understand that as well
-	Performance wise named queries done not make much difference, nor put any excessive cost

	-	The cost of transforming a HQL query to SQL is negligible compared to the cost of actually executing the query
	-	The memory cost of caching the query is really small
	-	Remember that Hibernate needs to have all the entities meta-data in memory anyway
	
	
##	Named Queries attributes

- 	@NamedQueries annotation will take array of @NamedQuery annotation as an input
-	Named query definition has two important attributes:

	-	name: The name of name query by which it will be located using hibernate session
	-	query: Here you give the HQL statement to get executed in database

	
## Example of Named Queries with department entity


-	There are two Named Queries in DepartmentEntity:
	-	One for updating a department name by it’s id
	-	And second for selecting a department by it’s id
	
-	DepartmentEntity.java

				@Entity
				@Table(name = "DEPARTMENT", uniqueConstraints = {
									@UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "ID"),
									@UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "NAME") })
				@NamedQueries
				(
					{
						@NamedQuery(name=DepartmentEntity.GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID, query=DepartmentEntity.GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID_QUERY),
						@NamedQuery(name=DepartmentEntity.UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID, query=DepartmentEntity.UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID_QUERY)
					}
				)
				public class DepartmentEntity implements Serializable {
					 
					static final String GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID_QUERY = "from DepartmentEntity d where d.id = :id";
					public static final String GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID = "GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID";
					 
					static final String UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID_QUERY = "UPDATE DepartmentEntity d SET d.name=:name where d.id = :id";
					public static final String UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID = "UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID";
					 
					private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
				 
					@Id
					@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
					@Column(name = "ID", unique = true, nullable = false)
					private Integer id;
					 
					@Column(name = "NAME", unique = true, nullable = false, length = 100)
					private String name;
				 
					public Integer getId() {
						return id;
					}
				 
					public void setId(Integer id) {
						this.id = id;
					}
				 
					public String getName() {
						return name;
					}
				 
					public void setName(String name) {
						this.name = name;
					}
				}

-	TestHibernateNamedQuery.java


		public class TestHibernateNamedQuery
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				//Open the hibernate session
				Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession();
				session.beginTransaction();
				try
				{
					//Update record using named query
					Query query = session.getNamedQuery(DepartmentEntity.UPDATE_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID)
												.setInteger("id", 1)
												.setString("name", "Finance");
					query.executeUpdate();
					 
					//Get named query instance
					query = session.getNamedQuery(DepartmentEntity.GET_DEPARTMENT_BY_ID)
												.setInteger("id", 1);
					//Get all departments (instances of DepartmentEntity)
					DepartmentEntity department = (DepartmentEntity) query.uniqueResult();
					System.out.println(department.getName());
				}
				finally
				{
					session.getTransaction().commit();
					HibernateUtil.shutdown();
				}
			}
		}

-	Output in console:
 
			Hibernate: update DEPARTMENT set NAME=? where ID=?
			Hibernate: select department0_.ID as ID0_, department0_.NAME as NAME0_ from DEPARTMENT department0_ where department0_.ID=?
			Finance
	
## Some Important Methods on the Hibernate Query Interface

-	query.list();
-	query.executeUpdate();
-	query.uniqueResult();
	
	
##	Important points on Named Queries:

-	We can not have two named queries with same name in hibernate
-	Hibernate fail fast behavior in syntax error and will show error in application start up itself
-	Please remember that result of named queries is not cached in secondary cache, only query object itself get cached
-	Use JPA style query language. e.g. in place of table name, use Entity name
