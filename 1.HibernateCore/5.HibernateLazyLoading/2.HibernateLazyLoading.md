# 	Hibernate Lazy Loading

-	Hibernate fetches data from databse either in eager or lazy mode
-	Hibernate lazy loading refer to strategy where data is loaded lazily, on demand


##	1. Hibernate lazy loading – why we need it?

-	Consider one of common Internet web application: the online store
-	The store maintains a catalog of products
-	In a large store, there may be tens of thousands of products grouped into various overlapping categories
-	When a customer visits the store, the catalog must be loaded from the database
-	We probably don’t want the implementation to load every single one of the entities representing the tens of thousands of products to be loaded into memory
-	Instead, we want only the catalog to load, possibly with the categories as well
-	When the user drills down into the categories should a subset of the products in that category be loaded from the database
-	To manage this problem, Hibernate provides a facility called lazy loading
-	When enabled, an entity’s associated entities will be loaded only when they are directly requested


##	2. How lazy loading solve above problem

-	To solve the above problem then we would be accessing a category (or catalog) in below manner

		//Following code loads only a single category from the database:
		Category category = (Category)session.get(Category.class,new Integer(42));
		
-	If all the products of this category needs to be accessed, and lazy loading is in effect, then products are pulled from the database as needed
-	In the following snippet, the associated product objects will be loaded since it's explicitly referenced in second line


			//Following code loads only a single category from the database
			Category category = (Category)session.get(Category.class,new Integer(42));
			 
			//This code will fetch all products for category 42 from database - "NOW"
			Set<Product> products = category.getProducts();
			
-	This solve our problem of loading the products only when they are needed

##	3. How to enable lazy loading in hibernate

-	The default behavior of Hibernate is to load ‘property values eagerly’ and to load ‘collections lazily’
-	@OneToMany and @ManyToMany associations are defaulted to LAZY loading
-	@OneToOne and @ManyToOne are defaulted to EAGER loading


-	To enable lazy loading explicitly we must use “fetch = FetchType.LAZY” on a association which we want to load lazily


			@OneToMany( mappedBy = "category", fetch = FetchType.LAZY )
			private Set<ProductEntity> products;
			
			
-	"FetchType.EAGER" which is just opposite to LAZY i.e. it will load association entity as well when owner entity is fetched first time


##	4. How lazy loading works in hibernate

-	Hibernate implements lazy loading by using proxy pattern on entities and associations
-	Hibernate puts the proxy implementation on the associated entities
-	When the association is represented as a collection class, then a wrapper of proxy collection is created and substituted for the original collection
	-	Essentially a proxy for the collection, rather than for the entities that it contains
-	When we access this collection proxy then what we get inside returned proxy collection are not proxy entities; rather they are actual entities


##	5. Effect of lazy loading on detached entities


-	hibernate can only access the database via a session
-	If an entity is detached from the session and we try to access an association (via a proxy or collection wrapper) that has not yet been loaded
	-	Hibernate throws a LazyInitializationException
	
-	In order to avoid this  we need to ensure that the entity is made persistent again by attaching it to a valid session
